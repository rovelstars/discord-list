# WARNING ⚠️!

We won't help anyone with any issues unless it's really legit.

Always remember to search the error on google and stackoverflow before asking us. We believe in FOSS but we are not going to spoonfeed you. Also do not spam to get help, we are humans, not robots therefore we are not available 24/7.

Also note that this codebase is under development, so it's not meant for public usage at the moment (Its usable for us, but not for other's deployments).

Please keep **bugs**, **issues** and **code related subjects** in our issues and pull requests. If they are posted on our Discord server they will be **IGNORED**. The website feedback looks at your likes, dislikes and suggestions on the front end, but not for bugfixes or other problems. Please bring them here if you really want help/to help.
