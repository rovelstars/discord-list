## Note: We don't care about other's to setup their own list, and we will not tolerate any questions asked about how to setup your own instance of the list. But if you think there's some problem with our code which won't run on vps or other places, please do let us know.

This project is open sourced for allowing us to be transparent in our work, and to prove that we are good. If you're trying to setup it, please do so only if you're testing it or helping us.
If you're running it publicly, as a self deployment, make sure to let us know about your website link in our support server.

> Thank you for your time and love that made us make this possible!
